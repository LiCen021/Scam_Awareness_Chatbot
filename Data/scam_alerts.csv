CBA_0003,30 October 2024 - Theft of shares,"Since August 2024, there has been a significant increase in reports of stolen shares. Criminals are impersonating individuals and stealing their shares, with many victims unaware their shares have been transferred or sold until they receive a confirmation letter in the mail from a share registry or the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS). Fraudulent activity using stolen identities is increasingly sophisticated, so it’s important to be vigilant. Remember to Stop, Check and Reject calls, emails and messages that appear suspicious. Here are 4 ways you can increase the security of your CommSec account. SMS security: SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) and SMS one-time password (OTP) allows you to verify your identity with a code, sent to you via text message. Security Q&A: These questions will be used to identify you if you forget your password, or whenever we need extra verification. Trading Password: A trading password, which is different to your login password, can add an extra level of security to your account. It can be used to authenticate a user as an authorised operator on the account when placing orders via the CommSec website, CommSec mobile app or CommSec IRESS. Phone Pin: A 6–16-digit numerical password that can be used to identify you when you call us.",,CommBank
